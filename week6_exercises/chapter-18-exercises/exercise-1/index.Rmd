## This is my report!

I like writing reports



```{r setup, include=F}
library(knitr)source("exercise.R")  # load exercise file
```
 

```{r example, echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)
numbers <- runif(1:100) # make a randpm numbers

hist(numbers) # show histogram of numbers
numbers_mean <- mean(numbers) # get the mean

img_url <- "![Avengers](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81gCaSnFTvL._SL1364_.jpg)"

letters <- c("a", "b", "c", "d")
numbers <- 1:4
df <- data.frame(letters = letters, numbers = numbers)

kable(df) # This will make a table 
```

The mean of the numbers happens to be **`r numbers_mean`**

`r img_url`



```{r other_chunk, include = FALSE}
print(numbers)
```
